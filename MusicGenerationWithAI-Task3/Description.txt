In this project, I demonstrated the use of artificial intelligence to generate original music. By leveraging deep learning techniques, particularly Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers, the system learns patterns from classical music and creates new compositions. I used a dataset of MIDI files from Beethoven's works for training, which makes the generated music stylistically similar to classical compositions.
