I developed a Healthcare FAQ Chatbot that provides instant responses to frequently asked healthcare-related questions. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP), the chatbot preprocesses user queries and employs a TF-IDF vectorizer with cosine similarity to match them with predefined FAQs. The chatbot is integrated into a user-friendly GUI built with Tkinter, featuring a scrolled text area for conversation display and an input field for queries. Key features include accurate answer retrieval, support for a variety of healthcare topics like telemedicine, appointments, and emergencies, and a fallback response when no relevant match is found.
