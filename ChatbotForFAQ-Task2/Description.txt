In this project, I developed a Healthcare FAQ Chatbot using Python with Tkinter for the graphical user interface (GUI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to understand and respond to user queries. The chatbot is designed to help users by answering common questions about healthcare services, such as clinic operating hours, how to book appointments, online consultations, and accepted insurance plans. I used TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization and Cosine Similarity to match the user’s query with the most relevant answer from a predefined list of FAQs. To enhance user experience, I included an introductory message in the GUI, guiding users on how to interact with the chatbot, along with sample questions to get them started. The chatbot responds to user queries with relevant answers, making it an efficient tool for healthcare providers to automate responses to frequently asked questions. This project allowed me to apply NLP and machine learning techniques while creating a simple, interactive interface that’s easy for users to navigate.
