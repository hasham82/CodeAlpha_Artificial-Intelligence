I developed a Language Translation Tool that allows users to translate text between different languages using pre-trained machine translation models. The tool leverages the Google Translate API to facilitate seamless text translation. It provides an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) with features such as language selection, text input, and translation output. Additionally, the tool includes a voice feature for both speech-to-text input and text-to-speech output, enhancing accessibility and interactivity.
