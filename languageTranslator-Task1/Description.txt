I developed an AI-based language translator using Python and the Google Translate API. The tool features a user-friendly interface built with Tkinter, allowing users to input text, select source and target languages, and get real-time translations. It supports auto-detection of the input language and offers translation for multiple languages. This project highlights my skills in API integration and GUI development.
