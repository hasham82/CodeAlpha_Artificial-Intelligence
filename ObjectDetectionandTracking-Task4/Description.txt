I worked on a project called "Object Detection Using YOLOv10," where I implemented real-time object detection using the YOLOv10 model. It processes live webcam feeds to identify and annotate objects with bounding boxes, class names, and confidence scores. The system is highly accurate and capable of detecting various objects, making it useful for tasks like surveillance and robotics.
